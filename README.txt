To start the project you need to do:
	1.1 npm install
	1.2 bower install
	1.3 grunt development
	
	It will create local environment for testing the app and will open automatically tab in browser or open it by yourself http://localhost:9000/

I have implemented small logic for mock server response and etc.
This event based architecture, so it's almost the same as server responses. 

You will see on top buttons they will initiate different tests. They work one by one (test), in order. 
So you will be able to see my app in action.

Enjoy :)
